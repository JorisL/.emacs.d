#+TITLE: .emacs.d README
My Emacs config.

The config is mainly written using org-babel in =dotemacs.org=.
=init.el= has some boilerplate code to load the main configuration.

=.secrets.el= is a file that should be added manually since it hosts info that shouldn't be in git (example; computer specific info, passwords, etc.).
